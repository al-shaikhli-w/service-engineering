Service and cloud computing have evolved from "classic" (intra-) enterprise application integration (EAI) to global, Internet-based inter-enterprise service integration. In the future, the flexible access to IT capacities will be analogous to electricity and water supply and subsumed under the term cloud computing. The cloud enables flexibility and scalability of hardware (infrastructure-as-a-service), software (software-as-a-service) and system environments (platform-as-a-service, including e.g. docker) and provides metered services according to the "pay per use"-principle. The success of SaaS pioneer Salesforce.com or Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud emphasizes the commercial importance of service and cloud computing. The strong interest of IT giants such as Microsoft, Google and IBM in cloud computing technologies emphasizes the sustainability of this trend.
